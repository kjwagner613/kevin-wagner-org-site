            <h1>Count 2 and Response</h1>
            <p>Menacing constituting Domestic Violence (ORS 163.190)</p>

            <h2>Statutory language</h2>
            <p>"A person commits the crime of menacing if by word or conduct the person intentionally attempts to
                place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury."</p>

            <h2>DV inclusion note</h2>
            <p>When menacing constitutes <strong>domestic violence</strong> under ORS 132.586, the judgment reflects
                that designation. This may affect penalties, reporting, restraining orders, custody, and immigration
                consequences.</p>

            <h2>Qualification checklist</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>If the person acted intentionally, continue; otherwise not menacing (intent required).</li>
                <li>If the person used words or conduct, continue; otherwise not menacing (no act).</li>
                <li>If the act was intended to place another in fear, continue; otherwise not menacing.</li>
                <li>If the feared harm is serious physical injury, continue; otherwise not menacing.</li>
                <li>If the threatened harm was imminent, continue; otherwise not menacing.</li>
                <li>If conduct was a substantial step toward causing that fear, menacing under ORS 163.190; otherwise
                    not menacing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Oregon definition of "imminent"</h2>
            <p>In Oregon cases, "imminent" means harm that is immediate and impending, not remote, speculative, or
                dependent on future events.</p>

            <h2>Response</h2>
            <p>This incident does not meet the qualifications or definitions required to proceed.</p>
            <p>When police arrived, I was asleep in my bed, and she was in a different room. There was no active
                interaction. Sleeping in bed is not menacing conduct.</p>

            <h2>Response to domestic violence designation</h2>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Not family members.</li>
                <li>Not household members; she was a temporary guest and did not share expenses or responsibilities.
                </li>
                <li>Not intimate partners; we are friends, and she is engaged.</li>
                <li>No child in common.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>She called while in Sacramento and asked to stay temporarily due to health and environment concerns. I
                agreed, as I had before.</p>
            <p>I told police she is not on the lease, we have no shared bank accounts, and no shared life
                infrastructure.</p>
            <p class="listComment">The alleged facts are outside the legal scope of these charges.</p>
