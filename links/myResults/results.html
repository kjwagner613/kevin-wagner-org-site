        <h2 id="overview" class="sec-overview">Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Domestic Violence Classification (Threshold Issue)</strong></p>
        <p>Both charges depend on proving the complainant is a “family or household member” under ORS 135.230.</p>
        <p>There was:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No romantic or sexual relationship</li>
            <li>No shared finances or responsibilities</li>
            <li>Separate beds</li>
            <li>Temporary guest status</li>
            <li>She is engaged to someone else</li>
            <li>No shared child</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Under Oregon law, “cohabitation” requires a marriage-like relationship, not simply residing under the same
            roof.</p>
        <p>If this element fails, the DV designation fails, and Count 1 loses its felony enhancement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No photos</li>
            <li>No medical exam</li>
            <li>No visible injuries documented</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is significant in a strangulation case, where officers are trained to document injuries and encourage
            medical evaluation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Result: demand full discovery</li>
            <li>Examine whether officers followed protocol</li>
            <li>Assess credibility issues arising from intoxication and recantation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="motions" class="sec-motions">Motions to Consider</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Motion to dismiss DV enhancement (failure to meet ORS 135.230)</li>
            <li>Motion to reduce Count 1 (no aggravator = misdemeanor)</li>
            <li>Motion for judgment of acquittal on Count 2 (failure of statutory elements)</li>
            <li>Motion to compel missing evidence (bodycam, 911, medical, statements)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="critical" class="sec-critical">Critical Points</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Felony enhancement may be unsupported</li>
            <li>DV classification is questionable</li>
            <li>Menacing elements appear unmet</li>
            <li>Strangulation lacks corroboration</li>
            <li>Complainant intoxicated and recanting</li>
            <li>No medical or photographic evidence</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="summary" class="sec-summary">Summary of Issues to Develop</h2>
        <p>Whether the State can prove a qualifying “family or household member” relationship under ORS 135.230.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Whether Count 1 qualifies as a felony under ORS 163.187(4), and if not, whether it must be reduced.</li>
            <li>Whether the elements of menacing (intent, imminence, substantial step) are met.</li>
            <li>Whether the DV designation is legally supportable under ORS 132.586.</li>
            <li>Whether the evidence supports “impeding breathing” as required for strangulation.</li>
            <li>Whether bodycam, 911 audio, medical records, and witness statements contradict the indictment.</li>
            <li>Whether motions to dismiss, reduce, or exclude evidence are appropriate.</li>
            <li>Whether the State’s theory is internally inconsistent with the physical evidence and timeline.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="note">The following analysis leads to the position that this case appears to lack the evidentiary
            foundation required to sustain the charges as written.</p>

        <h2 id="reasoning" class="sec-reasoning">Reasoning</h2>
        <h3>1. Indictment Theory of Domestic Violence Status</h3>
        <p><em>Key issue:</em> Whether the State can legally classify the alleged conduct as “domestic violence” under
            Oregon law.</p>
        <p>Both counts depend on proving a qualifying “family or household member” relationship under ORS 135.230.</p>
        <p>Requires: “Victim is family member or household member as defined in ORS 135.230.”</p>
        <p>Argument: “She was a guest staying for a little while… no shared expenses, responsibilities… two beds here…
            she is engaged.”</p>
        <p><strong>Need to examine:</strong> whether the State can prove “cohabitation” under Oregon law.</p>
        <p>The statute requires a marriage-like relationship, not simply living under the same roof (“nature of the
            relationship… shared residence and mutual responsibilities… presentation as a couple”).</p>
        <p>Points to argue:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No shared finances</li>
            <li>No romantic or sexual relationship</li>
            <li>No shared responsibilities</li>
            <li>Separate beds</li>
            <li>Temporary guest status</li>
            <li>She has a fianc&eacute; elsewhere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a threshold issue. If the relationship does not qualify, both charges lose their DV enhancement, and
            Count 1 may lose felony status entirely.</p>

        <h3>2. Count 1: Strangulation (Class C Felony)</h3>
        <p><em>Key issue:</em> Whether any statutory aggravator exists.</p>
        <p>The felony-elevating factors under ORS 163.187(4): “Victim is family or household member…
            victim under 10… weapon… prior convictions… pregnancy…”</p>
        <p><strong>Attorney should analyze:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A. Which aggravator the State is relying on</strong></p>
        <p>The indictment states: “The victim is a family or household member.”</p>
        <p>This suggests reliance solely on the “family or household member” aggravator. If that fails, Count 1 may
            reduce from a Class C felony to a Class A misdemeanor.</p>
        <p><strong>B. Whether the State can prove “impeding breathing”</strong></p>
        <p>The indictment alleges: “impede the normal breathing or blood circulation… by applying pressure on the throat
            and neck or chest…”</p>
        <p>Items to examine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical evidence: none (did not take her to hospital)</li>
            <li>Photographs: none</li>
            <li>Officer observations: if injury was observed, medical attention should have been pushed</li>
            <li>Statements made at the scene</li>
            <li>Whether alleged conduct is physically consistent with “impeding breathing”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If evidence is weak or inconsistent, this is a major defense point.</p>

        <h3>3. Count 2: Menacing (Domestic Violence)</h3>
        <p><em>Key issue:</em> Whether the statutory elements are met.</p>
        <p>Test language: “IF the person acted intentionally… IF the act was intended to place another in fear… IF the
            threatened harm was imminent…”</p>
        <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A. Intent</strong></p>
        <p>“When the police got here, I was asleep in my bed… no interaction going on.”</p>
        <p>State may not be able to prove:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intentional conduct</li>
            <li>An attempt</li>
            <li>Imminence</li>
            <li>A substantial step</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a major evidentiary contradiction.</p>
        <p><strong>B. Imminence</strong></p>
        <p>“Imminent” means immediate and impending, not remote or speculative.</p>
        <p>If the alleged threat occurred earlier, and police found both parties in separate rooms asleep or calm,
            imminence is undermined.</p>
        <p><strong>C. Substantial Step</strong></p>
        <p>Menacing is an attempt crime. Questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What conduct constitutes the “substantial step”?</li>
            <li>Is there evidence of action taken at the time police arrived?</li>
            <li>Is the allegation purely retrospective?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the only evidence is a statement made after the fact, it is a weak menacing case.</p>

        <h3>4. Domestic Violence Designation</h3>
        <p><em>Key issue:</em> Whether the DV label is legally supportable.</p>
        <p>“Domestic violence designation applies when the victim and offender are in a qualifying relationship under
            ORS 132.586.”</p>
        <p>Analyze:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether the State can prove the relationship</li>
            <li>Whether the DV designation is improperly applied</li>
            <li>Whether the indictment’s DV language is conclusory rather than factual</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the relationship fails, the DV designation must be removed.</p>
        <p>This affects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firearm rights</li>
            <li>Sentencing</li>
            <li>Probation terms</li>
            <li>Future background checks</li>
            <li>Federal reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Evidentiary Weaknesses to Investigate</h3>
        <p><strong>A. Body-worn camera footage</strong> (verify condition, demeanor, statements, physical evidence)</p>
        <p><strong>B. 911 call and dispatch logs</strong> (who called, what was said, fear expressed, contradictions)
        </p>
        <p><strong>C. Medical records</strong> (signs of strangulation, injuries, inconsistencies)</p>
        <p><strong>D. Witness statements</strong> (corroboration, statement changes)</p>
        <p><strong>E. Prior relationship evidence</strong> to establish:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No romantic relationship</li>
            <li>No cohabitation</li>
            <li>No shared finances</li>
            <li>No shared responsibilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This directly attacks DV classification.</p>

        <h3>6. Procedural Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motion to Dismiss DV Enhancements:</strong> if relationship definition fails, DV designation is
                improper.</li>
            <li><strong>Motion to Reduce Count 1 to Misdemeanor:</strong> if no aggravator applies, Count 1 cannot be a
                felony.</li>
            <li><strong>Motion for Judgment of Acquittal (MJOA) on Menacing:</strong> if intent, imminence, and
                substantial step are not proven, menacing cannot stand.</li>
            <li><strong>Motion to Compel Discovery:</strong> if medical evidence, bodycam, witness statements, or photos
                have not been produced.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7. Narrative Issues</h3>
        <p>“She was a guest… temporary help for a friend… she is engaged… no shared infrastructure.”</p>
        <p>Prepare:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear, consistent narrative</li>
            <li>Corroborating evidence (texts, messages, lease, photos of separate beds)</li>
            <li>Timeline reconstruction</li>
            <li>Evidence of her fianc&eacute; and living situation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is essential for undermining DV classification.</p>
        <p class="note">State theory challenge: no physical evidence, no corroboration, and complainant recantation.</p>

        <h2 id="breakdown" class="sec-breakdown">Additional Breakdown</h2>
        <h3>1. Legal Elements Require Evidence</h3>
        <p>The State must prove:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Impeding breathing for strangulation</li>
            <li>Intent + imminence + substantial step for menacing</li>
            <li>A qualifying domestic relationship for DV status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There were no photographs, no medical attention, no witnesses. She was intoxicated at the
            time. She was recanting when I saw her in court at the last court date, Jan 30th, 2026.</p>
        <p>These are direct contradictions to factual assertions in the indictment.</p>

        <h3>2. Lack of Medical Evidence</h3>
        <p>Strangulation cases normally require documented indicators such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Petechiae</li>
            <li>Bruising</li>
            <li>Redness</li>
            <li>Hoarseness</li>
            <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
            <li>Medical evaluation</li>
            <li>Photographs</li>
            <li>Officer observations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Without corroboration, the State&rsquo;s burden becomes extremely difficult.</p>

        <h3>3. No Photographs = No Contemporaneous Documentation</h3>
        <p>Emphasize: &ldquo;They did not take any photographs.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>This matters because the indictment claims: &ldquo;impede the normal breathing or blood circulation&hellip;
            by
            applying pressure on the throat or neck&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
        <p>If officers believed that happened, they would normally photograph:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The neck</li>
            <li>The chest</li>
            <li>The face</li>
            <li>The scene</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The absence of photos is a glaring omission.</p>

        <h3>4. No Hospital Transport = No Medical Corroboration</h3>
        <p>They did not take her to the hospital.</p>
        <p>In strangulation cases, officers are trained to strongly encourage medical evaluation because internal
            injuries
            can be invisible.</p>
        <p>If they did not, it suggests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They did not observe signs consistent with strangulation</li>
            <li>They did not believe medical risk was present</li>
            <li>They did not see evidence supporting the allegation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a major point that should be explored.</p>

        <h3>5. Recantation Is a Critical Factor</h3>
        <p>This is something that should be aggressively pursued:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Written recantation</li>
            <li>Recorded recantation</li>
            <li>Sworn affidavit</li>
            <li>Text messages</li>
            <li>Statements to third parties</li>
            <li>Statements to police after the fact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While recantation does not automatically end a case, it dramatically weakens the State&rsquo;s position,
            especially when combined with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No injuries</li>
            <li>No photos</li>
            <li>No medical evidence</li>
            <li>No witnesses</li>
            <li>No corroboration</li>
            <li>No DV qualifying relationship</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the kind of record that creates a structurally unsound case.</p>

        <h3>7. Being Found Asleep Is Incompatible with &ldquo;Imminent Threat&rdquo;</h3>
        <p>When the police arrived, I was asleep in my bed. She was in bed in the other room.</p>
        <p>This directly contradicts the indictment&rsquo;s claim that I was: &ldquo;grabbing her by the throat,
            squeezing,
            while yelling that I was going to kill her.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Imminence cannot exist when the accused is asleep in another room.&rdquo; This seems a textbook
            failure of
            the statutory elements.</p>

        <h3>8. The DV Relationship Element Is Unsupported</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No romantic relationship</li>
            <li>No sexual relationship</li>
            <li>No shared finances</li>
            <li>No shared responsibilities</li>
            <li>Separate beds</li>
            <li>Temporary guest</li>
            <li>She has a fianc&eacute; elsewhere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cite ORS 135.230 and the cohabitation factors.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If the relationship fails, the DV designation fails, and the felony enhancement fails.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>This is a threshold issue and should be challenged immediately.</p>

        <h3>9. What Should Be Happening Right Now</h3>
        <h3>A. Demand Full Discovery</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bodycam</li>
            <li>911 call</li>
            <li>Dispatch logs</li>
            <li>Officer reports</li>
            <li>Medical records (if any)</li>
            <li>Witness statements</li>
            <li>Any recorded recantations</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>B. Challenge the DV Classification</h3>
        <p>Use ORS 135.230 and the documented factors.</p>
        <h3>C. Challenge the Felony Enhancement</h3>
        <p>If DV classification fails, Count 1 cannot be a felony.</p>
        <h3>D. Challenge the Elements of Menacing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No intent</li>
            <li>No imminence</li>
            <li>No substantial step</li>
            <li>No confrontation</li>
            <li>I was asleep</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>E. Challenge the Elements of Strangulation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No medical evidence</li>
            <li>No photos</li>
            <li>No officer-observed injuries</li>
            <li>No corroboration</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>F. Document the Recantation</h3>
        <p>This is crucial.</p>
        <h3>G. Prepare Motions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Motion to dismiss DV enhancement</li>
            <li>Motion to reduce Count 1</li>
            <li>Motion for judgment of acquittal on Count 2</li>
            <li>Motion to compel missing evidence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This case appears to lack the evidentiary foundation required to sustain the charges as written. For defense,
            counsel should probe, aggressively, the absence of corroboration, the recantation, the lack of a qualifying
            relationship, and the failure to meet statutory elements.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Potential next steps:</strong> This analytical framework can now be converted by counsel into formal motions and
            strategic pressure.</p>
